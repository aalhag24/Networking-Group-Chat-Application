# Introduction
This project contains my implementation of routing, IP header, and TCP sessions to create a group chat application throught the python file called Application.py

## Noise
/noise/  This is the "noise" of the network. A heavy noised network will cause issues with
packet loss.

* **no_noise.txt** - There should be no packet loss using this model.

## Topography
/topo/ This folder contains a few example topographies of the network and how they are
connected to each other. Be sure to try additional networks when testing your code
since additional ones will be added when grading.

* **long_line.topo** - this topography is a line of 19 motes that have bidirectional links.
* **example.topo** - A slightly more complex connection

# Running Simulations
